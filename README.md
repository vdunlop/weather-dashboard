This dashboard will show the current weather as well as the 5-day forecast for the city the user chooses.

## Description
The weather dashboard will accept a city as input. When the user clicks the Search button, the city's current weather will display, along with a 5-Day forecast. That city will be added to a list of past searches so that the user can click on a past search to bring up that city's weather again.

## Usage
The Weather Dashboard can be used for several purposes:

1. An easy way to look up the weather for a city. You will receive current weather and a 5-Day forecast.

2. An easy way to look up the weather for several cities. By searching for a city, you will see the current weather and 5-Day forecast, and then be able to click on past cities that you have searched for. This makes for an easy way to compare weather in many cities if, for example, you are scheduling a trip and want to know what order to visit the sites in.
